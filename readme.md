# Portfolio Project

## My Website

### Purpose

The purpose of this portfolio project was to practice and implement front-end coding skills learned at Coder Academy as well as doubling as a way to showcase those skills to my peers and potential employers. It's an interesting experience executing the lessons learned in class as well as developing and learning new skills in the process.
